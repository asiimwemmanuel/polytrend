these contain different areas to improve functionality of PolyTrend

Support for Additional Function Types: Expand the script to include more predefined function types or allow users to define their own custom functions. This would provide greater flexibility in fitting a wider range of mathematical relationships.

Nonlinear Regression Methods: Incorporate additional nonlinear regression methods beyond curve_fit(), such as least squares minimization or maximum likelihood estimation. This would offer alternative approaches to fitting the data and provide more robustness in handling complex relationships.

Statistical Evaluation: Include statistical evaluation metrics to quantify the goodness of fit, such as R-squared, adjusted R-squared, or information criteria (e.g., AIC, BIC). These metrics can help assess the quality of the fitted models and allow for model comparison.

Handling of Outliers and Data Issues: Implement mechanisms to handle outliers and address common data issues, such as missing values, heteroscedasticity, or autocorrelation. This could involve preprocessing steps or incorporating appropriate robust regression techniques.

Confidence Intervals and Uncertainty Analysis: Extend the script to calculate and visualize confidence intervals around the fitted curves. This would provide insights into the uncertainty associated with the estimated parameters and aid in drawing reliable conclusions from the fitted models.

Model Selection and Comparison: Enhance the script to include model selection techniques, such as information criteria (e.g., AIC, BIC) or cross-validation, to objectively compare different function types and determine the most suitable model for the data.

Documentation and Error Handling: Improve the script's documentation by providing clear instructions, examples, and explanations for each function and parameter. Implement proper error handling to capture and handle potential runtime errors or invalid inputs.

Additional Visualization Options: Consider adding more visualization options, such as residual plots, histograms, or diagnostic plots, to aid in model validation, checking assumptions, and identifying potential issues in the fitted models.
