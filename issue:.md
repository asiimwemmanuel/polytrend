## issue:

performance loss & heavy executable due to no VM?
compile on new machine in place of cross-compilation

## ALBERT'S STICKS UP HIS ASS:

make text bigger
comma delimiters
explain input degrees

version 2
find/hide optional forecasts

"line of best fit", different color

make relationship between x and y more obvious/distinct

make fully responsive (solved with native compilation)
